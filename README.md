# FlamePython2

This is a Python implementation of the [Flames Fractals](http://flam3.com/flame_draves.pdf) algorithm.

The Fractal Flame algorithm is a two-dimensional Iterated Function System (IFS) that creates images by plotting the output of an attractor on the image plane. This algorithm is distinguished by its use of non-linear functions, log-density display, and structural coloring, which together result in a wide range of visually interesting images.

To use this implementation, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README.md file within the repository.
